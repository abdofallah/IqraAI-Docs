While the [Billing](/platform/billing) tab handles the money coming *in*, the **Usage Tab** tracks where the resources are going *out*.

This dashboard is your "Receipt." It provides granular transparency into every second of audio processed and every token generated.

## Usage Overview

The **Overview Tab** provides high-level metrics for business owners.

*   **Cost Analysis:** View your total spend over time (Daily/Monthly).
*   **Volume Metrics:** Track total Calls, Minutes, and Request counts.
*   **Grouping:** Break down costs by:
    *   **Day/Month:** Spot usage spikes.
    *   **Business:** Identify which Workspace/Client is consuming the most resources.

<Callout type="tip" title="Cost Control">
  Use the **Group by Business** feature to determine the profitability of your agency clients. If "Client A" is costing $500 but paying you $300, you need to adjust their plan.
</Callout>

## Usage History

The **History Tab** is the detailed ledger. It records every single billable event in the system.

### Understanding Line Items
Each row represents a specific consumption event.

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Date** | Timestamp of the event. |
| **Business** | Which workspace generated this cost. |
| **Feature** | The resource used (e.g., `Conversation Minutes`, `Voicemail Detection`, `TTS Cache Queries`). |
| **Quantity** | The amount consumed (e.g., `5.2 Minutes`, `1 Detection`, `5 Cache Queries`). |
| **Cost** | The final amount deducted from your balance (or quota). |

### Filtering
You can drill down into specific data points using the filter bar:
*   **Date Range:** "Last 7 Days", "This Month", or Custom Range.
*   **Business:** Isolate logs for a specific client workspace.
