In Iqra AI, a **Business** acts as a "Workspace" or "Project". It is a strictly isolated container for your Agents, Scripts, Phone Numbers, and Knowledge Bases.

## The Businesses Tab

Upon logging in, you are presented with the **Businesses Tab**. This is your portfolio view.

*   **Card View:** Each business is represented as a card showing its name and logo.
*   **Search:** Filter through your businesses (useful for agencies with 50+ clients).
*   **Quick Actions:** Delete or Edit metadata directly from the card menu.

<Callout type="warn" title="Data Isolation">
  Resources are **not shared** between businesses.
  *   An Agent created in *Business A* cannot access a Knowledge Base in *Business B*.
  *   A Phone Number bought in *Business A* cannot be routed to a Script in *Business B*.
  
  This design ensures strict data privacy and security for agencies managing multiple clients.
</Callout>

## Creating a Business

<Steps>
<Step>
### Click "Add Business"
Located in the top right corner of the Businesses tab.
</Step>

<Step>
### Business Details
Enter the core details for the workspace:
*   **Name:** The display name (e.g., "Medina Dental Clinic").
*   **Logo:** (Optional) Upload a brand icon. This is helpful for quick identification in the dashboard.
</Step>

<Step>
### Confirmation
Once created, the new business card will appear in your list.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Accessing the Workspace

To start building agents, you need to enter the **Business Dashboard**.

Simply **click on the Business Card**. This will redirect you from `app.iqra.bot/businesses` to `app.iqra.bot/business/{business_id}`.

> You will notice the sidebar changes completely. You have now transitioned from the **User Context** (Admin) to the **Business Context** (Builder).

## Deleting a Business

You can delete a business from the card menu.

<Callout type="error" title="Irreversible Action">
  Deleting a business will **permanently destroy**:
  *   All Agents and Scripts.
  *   All Conversation History and Logs.
  *   All uploaded Knowledge Base documents.
  *   **Phone Numbers:** Any connected numbers may be released depending on the provider configuration.

## Use Cases

When should you create a new Business?

| **Agencies** | Create one Business per **Client**. This allows you to hand over the specific workspace later if needed via Whitelabeling. |
| **Enterprises** | Create one Business per **Department** (e.g., "Sales Dept", "Support Dept") to keep billing and analytics segmented. |
| **Developers** | Create separate Businesses for **Staging** and **Production** environments. |
