In Iqra AI, a **Business** acts as a "Workspace" or "Project Container."

It is the fundamental unit of isolation. An Agent, Script, or Phone Number belongs to exactly **one** Business. This ensures that data, logs, and API keys never leak between different projects or clients.

## The Businesses Tab

Upon logging in to the [User Dashboard](/platform), you land on the **Businesses Tab**. This is your portfolio view.

*   **Card View:** Displays all workspaces you own or have access to.
*   **Search:** Quickly filter businesses (optimized for agencies managing 100+ clients).
*   **Metadata:** See at a glance the active plan or status of the workspace.

## Creating a Business

<Steps>
<Step>
### Click "Add Business"
Located in the top right corner of the Businesses tab.
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Identity
*   **Name:** The display name (e.g., "Medina Dental Clinic").
*   **Logo:** (Optional but Recommended) Upload a brand icon.
</Step>

<Step>
### Confirmation
Once created, the new business card will appear in your list immediately.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Accessing the Workspace

To start building, you must enter the **Business Context**.

Simply **click on the Business Card**.
*   **URL Change:** You will move from `/businesses` to `/business/{id}/overview`.
*   **Sidebar Change:** The sidebar will switch from "Platform Management" (Billing, API Keys) to "Builder Tools" (Agents, Scripts, Routing).

<Callout type="tip" title="Where do I go next?">
  Once inside a Business, you are ready to build. Check out the **[Build & Deploy](/build)** section to start creating:
  *   **[Agents](/build/agent):** Define the persona.
  *   **[Scripts](/build/script):** Build the logic graph.
  *   **[Routing](/build/campaigns):** Connect phone numbers.
</Callout>

## Deleting a Business

You can delete a business from the card menu (`...` icon).

<Callout type="error" title="Irreversible Action">
  Deleting a business is **destructive**. It will permanently remove:
  *   All Agents, Scripts, and Flow configurations.
  *   All Conversation History, Recordings, and Logs.
  *   **Phone Numbers:** Connected numbers may be released or disconnected depending on the carrier integration.
