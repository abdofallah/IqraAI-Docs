The **Plans** module allows you to define the economy of your whitelabeled platform. By creating Plans, you package Iqra AI's capabilities into subscription tiers (e.g., "Starter", "Professional", "Enterprise") that you can assign to your clients.

## Plan Anatomy

A Plan consists of three main components:

1.  **Base Subscription:** The fixed monthly fee for access (e.g., $49/month).
2.  **Usage-Based Features:** Consumables like Call Minutes. You define how many are included in the base fee and the cost per unit if the user exceeds that limit.
3.  **Recurring Features:** Fixed monthly add-ons, such as additional **Conversation Concurrency** slots.

## Creating a Plan

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create New Plan
Navigate to **Whitelabel** -> **Plans** and click **Add Plan**.
</Step>

<Step>
### Basic Configuration
*   **Name:** The display name (e.g., "Gold Tier").
*   **Description:** Internal note or display text for the plan.
*   **Pricing Model:**
    *   **Fixed Monthly Price:** The customer pays a set amount every month regardless of usage (until limits are hit).
    *   **Pay As You Go:** No monthly fee; the customer only pays for exactly what they use.
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Call Minutes (Usage)
This is the most critical setting. You need to define the logic for voice usage.

*   **Included Quantity:** How many minutes are "free" with the base subscription? (e.g., 100 minutes).
*   **Unit Price:** (Optional) The cost calculation value for the included minutes (internal tracking).
*   **Overage Unit Price:** The cost per minute **after** the included 100 minutes are used up.

**Example Logic:**
> If a plan includes 100 minutes and has an Overage Price of $0.20:
> *   Usage: 80 mins > Cost: Base Fee only.
> *   Usage: 150 mins > Cost: Base Fee + (50 mins * $0.20).
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Recurring Features
You can bill for capacity. Since you (the Agency) provide the infrastructure, you can charge for **Conversation Concurrency**.

*   **Included Quantity:** How many simultaneous calls allow in the base plan?
*   **Unit Price:** The monthly rental cost for every *additional* concurrency slot the user wants to purchase.
</Step>

<Step>
### Hard Limits
You can restrict the maximum "horsepower" of the plan to prevent abuse.
*   **Max Concurrency:** The absolute maximum number of simultaneous calls this plan allows, regardless of add-ons.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Payment Collection

Currently, Iqra AI handles the **Calculation** of the bill, but the **Collection** of funds is managed by you externally.

*   **Manual Process:** You collect payment from your client (via Stripe Invoice, Bank Transfer, etc.) based on the usage report we provide.
*   **Credit Adjustment:** Once paid, you manually update the customer's balance in the [Customer Billing](/platform/whitelabel/customers#billing-management) section.

  We are actively integrating with **Whop** and **Stripe Connect**. Soon, you will be able to process credit card payments for Plans directly inside the whitelabeled dashboard.

## Assigning Plans

Creating a plan does not apply it to anyone automatically. You must assign it to a specific customer.

1.  Navigate to the **Customers** tab.
2.  Edit a specific Customer.
3.  Go to their **Billing** section.
4.  Select the **Plan** from the dropdown to apply it.
