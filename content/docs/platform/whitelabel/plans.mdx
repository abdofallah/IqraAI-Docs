The **Plans** module allows you to define the economy of your whitelabeled platform. By creating Plans, you package Iqra AI's capabilities into subscription tiers (e.g., "Starter", "Professional", "Enterprise") that you can sell to your clients.

## Plan Anatomy

A Plan consists of three main components:

1.  **Base Subscription:** The monthly fee for the plan itself (e.g., $49/month).
2.  **Usage-Based Features:** Consumables like Call Minutes. You define how many are included and what the cost is if the user exceeds that limit.
3.  **Recurring Features:** Rentals like Phone Numbers. You define the monthly cost per item.

<Callout type="idea" title="Profit Margin">
  **Your Cost vs. Your Price:**
  You pay Iqra AI a base rate (e.g., $0.10/min). You can charge your customer a markup rate (e.g., $0.20/min) in these plans. The difference is your profit.
</Callout>

## Creating a Plan

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create New Plan
Navigate to **Whitelabel** -> **Plans** and click **Add Plan**.
</Step>

<Step>
### Basic Configuration
*   **Name:** The display name (e.g., "Gold Tier").
*   **Description:** Internal note or display text for the plan.
*   **Pricing Model:**
    *   **Fixed Monthly Price:** The customer pays a set amount every month regardless of usage (until limits are hit).
    *   **Pay As You Go:** No monthly fee; the customer only pays for exactly what they use.
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Call Minutes (Usage)
This is the most critical setting. You need to define the logic for voice usage.

*   **Included Quantity:** How many minutes are "free" with the base subscription? (e.g., 100 minutes).
*   **Unit Price:** (Optional) The cost calculation value for the included minutes.
*   **Overage Unit Price:** The cost per minute **after** the included 100 minutes are used up.

**Example Strategy:**
> You create a plan for **$50/month**.
> *   **Included:** 500 Minutes.
> *   **Overage:** $0.15 per minute.
>
> If a customer uses 400 minutes, they pay $50.
> If a customer uses 600 minutes, they pay $50 + (100 extra mins * $0.15) = $65.
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Recurring Features
These are assets the customer holds, such as **Phone Numbers**.

*   **Included Quantity:** How many numbers come free with the plan?
*   **Unit Price:** The monthly rental cost for every additional number.
</Step>

<Step>
### Limits & Concurrency
You can restrict the "horsepower" of the plan.
*   **Concurrency:** The maximum number of simultaneous calls the customer can have active. High concurrency is usually reserved for Enterprise plans.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Assigning Plans

Once a plan is created, it does not apply to anyone automatically. You must:
1.  Go to the **Customers** tab.
2.  Edit a specific Customer.
3.  Go to their **Billing** section.
4.  Select the **Plan** from the dropdown to apply it.

## Best Practices

| Strategy | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **The "Loss Leader"** | Offer a low monthly price but high overage rates. Good for getting small clients on board. |
| **High Ticket** | High monthly price with massive "Included Minutes". Good for enterprise clients who want predictable billing. |
| **Strict Limits** | Use the **Concurrency** limit to force heavy users to upgrade to a higher tier plan. |
