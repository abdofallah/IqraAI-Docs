The **Domains** module is the backbone of the whitelabeling experience. It allows your customers to access their dashboard via your own URL (e.g., `agent.yourcompany.com`) rather than `iqra.bot`.

## How it Works

When you add a custom domain, Iqra AI maps incoming traffic from that URL to your specific whitelabel settings.

1.  **You** add the domain in the dashboard.
2.  **You** configure your DNS provider (GoDaddy, Cloudflare, Namecheap, etc.).
3.  **We** verify the connection and provision SSL certificates.
4.  **Your Clients** log in securely via your domain.

## Adding a Domain

<Steps>
<Step>
### Register the Domain
Navigate to **Whitelabel** -> **Domains** and click **Add Domain**.
</Step>

<Step>
### Enter Domain Name
Enter the full domain or subdomain you wish to use.
*   **Subdomain (Recommended):** `app.agency.com`, `portal.agency.com`
*   **Root Domain:** `agency-portal.com`

<Callout type="warn" title="No Paths">
  Do not include protocols (`https://`) or paths (`/login`). Just the domain name.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### DNS Configuration (CNAME)
You must prove ownership of the domain and route traffic to us. Log in to your DNS provider and add a **CNAME Record**.

| Type | Name (Host) | Value (Target) | TTL |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CNAME** | `@` or `subdomain` | `whitelabel.iqra.bot` | Automatic / 1 Hour |

> **Example:** If your domain is `agent.mybrand.com`, the Name/Host is `agent` and the Value is `whitelabel.iqra.bot`.
</Step>

<Step>
### SSL Configuration
Choose how you want to secure the connection (HTTPS).

*   **Automatic SSL (Recommended):** We use Let's Encrypt to automatically provision and renew certificates for you. Zero maintenance required.
*   **Custom SSL:** If you have your own certificate (e.g., for enterprise compliance), you can upload your **Private Key** and **Certificate Chain** manually.
</Step>

<Step>
### Verification
Once saved, Iqra AI will check for the CNAME record.
*   **Status: Pending** - DNS changes are propagating (can take up to 24 hours, usually minutes).
*   **Status: Active** - The domain is ready to use.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Domain Branding Overrides

A unique feature of Iqra AI is **Per-Domain Branding**.

If you have multiple domains (e.g., `agent.brand-a.com` and `agent.brand-b.com`), you can override the branding settings for each specific domain.

1.  Click the **Edit** icon next to an active domain.
2.  Navigate to the **Branding Override** section.
3.  Upload a logo or inject CSS specific to *this* domain only.

This allows a single Agency account to serve multiple distinct sub-brands.

## Troubleshooting

<Callout type="info" title="DNS Propagation">
  If your domain status is stuck in "Pending", please wait. DNS changes can take time to propagate across the internet. You can use tools like [whatsmydns.net](https://whatsmydns.net) to check if your CNAME is pointing to `whitelabel.iqra.bot`.
</Callout>

**Common Errors:**
*   **Proxy Status (Cloudflare):** If you use Cloudflare, ensure the "Proxy Status" is set to **DNS Only** (Grey Cloud) initially for verification.
*   **Conflicting Records:** Ensure there are no A Records or other CNAME records for the same subdomain.
