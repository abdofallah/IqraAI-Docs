As an Agency Owner, you control the keys to the kingdom. The **Customers** module allows you to create user accounts for your clients, granting them access to specific Business Workspaces under your brand.

## Customer Hierarchy

In the whitelabel ecosystem:
1.  **You (The Owner):** Manage the infrastructure and pay Iqra AI.
2.  **The Customer (The Tenant):** Logs in via your custom domain (e.g., `app.youragency.com`). They perceive the platform as *yours*.
3.  **Isolation:** Customers cannot see each other, nor can they see your master billing or other businesses.

## Onboarding a New Customer

## Billing Management (The "Bank" Role)

Since Iqra AI does not yet process credit card payments from *your* customers directly, you act as the Billing Administrator. You are responsible for collecting payment externally (e.g., Wire Transfer, Stripe Invoice) and then manually updating the platform to reflect that payment.

You access these controls by clicking **Edit** on a customer row and navigating to the **Billing** tab.

### 1. Balance Management
If a customer pays you $500 via bank transfer for usage credits:
*   **Action:** Go to **Credit Balance** -> **Adjust**.
*   **Operation:** Select "Add Credit".
*   **Amount:** Enter `500`.
*   **Result:** The customer now sees $500 in their dashboard and can make calls.

### 2. Plan & Subscription Status
You control the lifecycle of the subscription.
*   **Active:** Customer has full access.
*   **Past Due / Locked:** If an external invoice isn't paid, you can change the status to **Locked** to pause their services immediately.
*   **Change Plan:** You can upgrade/downgrade their plan at any time.

### 3. Usage Cycle Management
Plans usually have "Included Minutes" (e.g., 500 mins/month).
*   **Monitoring:** View exactly how many minutes/tokens they have consumed in the current cycle.
*   **Manual Reset:** If you need to restart their billing cycle early (or fix an error), you can click **Reset Usage Cycle**. This clears their "Consumed" counter back to zero.

### 4. Managing Add-ons
If a customer needs more capacity than their plan allows (e.g., "I need 10 more concurrent calls for a campaign today"):
*   **Action:** Go to **Recurring Features**.
*   **Modify:** Manually increase the **Quantity** of "Conversation Concurrency".
*   **Effect:** This increases the monthly recurring cost calculated by the system.

## Analytics & Auditing

Even though payments are manual, tracking is automated.

*   **Customer Usage Report:** View a detailed breakdown of every cost generated by the customer based on the **Unit Prices** you defined in their Plan.
*   **Profitability:** Compare the *Customer's Usage Cost* (what they "spent" based on your markup) vs. the *Actual Infrastructure Cost* (what you pay Iqra AI) to track your margins.
