As an agency using Iqra AI's Whitelabeling, you can onboard and manage your own clients directly through the platform. Each **Customer** represents an end-user who will access their dedicated **Business Workspace**.

## Customer Hierarchy

Within the whitelabeling system, a customer is a distinct entity that:
*   Logs in through your custom domain (e.g., `agent.yourcompany.com`).
*   Accesses only the specific Business Workspaces assigned to them.
*   Has their own billing and usage metrics managed by you.

<Callout type="info" title="Customer Isolation">
  Customers are isolated from each other and from your agency's master account. They only see what you grant them access to.
</Callout>

## Customer Management Table

On the **Customers Tab** within Whitelabeling settings, you will find:
*   **List of Customers:** Displays customer email, assigned businesses, and their current subscription status.
*   **Quick Actions:** Buttons to Add New Customer, Edit Customer Details, or Delete a Customer account.
