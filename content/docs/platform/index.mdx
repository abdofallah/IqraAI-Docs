The **User Dashboard** is the command center for your Iqra AI account. Unlike the Business Dashboard (which focuses on building agents), this level handles **Administration**, **Finance**, and **Tenancy**.

When you log in to [app.iqra.bot](https://app.iqra.bot), you land here.

## The Hierarchy

It is important to remember that **no agents live here**. This dashboard manages the *containers* (Businesses) that hold the agents.

*   **User Level (Here):** "I need to pay for credits" or "I need to add a new client workspace."
*   **Business Level:** "I need to change the voice of my agent" or "I need to check call logs."
