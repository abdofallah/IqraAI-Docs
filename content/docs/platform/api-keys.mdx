Iqra AI provides a full REST API, allowing you to manage your businesses, trigger calls, and retrieve conversation history programmatically. **API Keys** are the credentials used to authenticate these requests.

## Key Types & Scopes

To ensure security, Iqra AI allows you to scope your API keys.

| Scope | Description | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unrestricted (Master)** | Grants full access to **all** businesses owned by your user account. | account-level automation scripts. |
| **Business Restricted** | Limits access to specific Business Workspaces only. | Production apps, client-side integrations, or team members. |

<Callout type="warn" title="Security Best Practice">
  Always use **Business Restricted** keys whenever possible. If a restricted key is compromised, it only puts that specific workspace at risk, not your entire account.
</Callout>

## Managing API Keys

You can generate and revoke keys in the **API Keys Tab** of the User Dashboard.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create New Key
Click the **"Add API Key"** button.
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Permissions
1.  **Name:** Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Zapier Integration - Dental Clinic").
2.  **Scope:** Choose either "Unrestricted" or select specific Businesses from the dropdown.
</Step>

<Step>
### Copy Key
**Important:** The key is only shown *once* upon creation. Copy it immediately and store it securely (e.g., in your `.env` file). If you lose it, you will have to generate a new one.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Using the API

All API requests must be authenticated via the HTTP Header.

### Endpoint
The base URL for the API is:
```bash
https://app.iqra.bot/api/v1
```

### Authentication Header
Pass your key in the `Authorization` header using the `Token` prefix.

```bash title="Example Request (cURL)"
curl -X POST https://app.iqra.bot/api/v1/calls \
  -H "Authorization: Token iqra_sk_12345abcdef" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "campaign_id": "camp_123",
    "to_number": "+1234567890"
  }'
```

<Callout type="error" title="Keep it Secret">
  Never expose your API Key in client-side code (browsers, mobile apps). Always make API requests from your backend server.
