Iqra AI provides a full REST API, allowing you to manage your businesses, trigger calls, and retrieve conversation history programmatically. **API Keys** are the credentials used to authenticate these requests.

## Permission Scopes

To ensure security, Iqra AI allows granular control over what an API key can do. Access is defined by two dimensions: **Business Scope** (Where it can act) and **User Management** (What it can change).

### 1. Business Scope
Determines which workspaces the key can access.

| Scope | Description | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unrestricted** | Grants access to **all** businesses owned by your user account. | Global reporting scripts. |
| **Restricted** | Limits access to specific Business Workspaces only. | Production apps, client-side integrations, or team members. |

### 2. User Management Scope
Determines if the key can access sensitive account-level data (Billing, Whitelabeling, User Profile).

*   **Allow User Management Requests:** (Default: `Disabled`)
    *   **Enabled:** The key can access `/api/v1/user` endpoints.

<Callout type="warn" title="Security Best Practice">
  **Least Privilege Principle:** Always keep `User Management` **Disabled** unless you are specifically building a dashboard to manage billing or whitelabeling.
  
  For running agents or making calls, use a **Restricted Business Key** with **No User Management** access.
</Callout>

## Managing API Keys

You can generate and revoke keys in the **API Keys Tab** of the User Dashboard.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create New Key
Click the **"Add API Key"** button.
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Permissions
1.  **Name:** Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Zapier Integration - Dental Clinic").
2.  **Business Scope:** Choose "Unrestricted" or select specific Businesses.
3.  **User Management:** Toggle **User Management Access** only if necessary.
</Step>

<Step>
### Copy Key
**Important:** The key is only shown *once* upon creation. Copy it immediately and store it securely (e.g., in your `.env` file). If you lose it, you will have to generate a new one.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Using the API

All API requests must be authenticated via the HTTP Header.

### Endpoint & Reference
The base URL for the API is:
```bash
https://app.iqra.bot/api/v1
```

<Callout type="tip" title="API Reference">
  Want to see all available endpoints? Visit the interactive **[Developer API Reference](/api-reference)** to test requests directly in your browser.
</Callout>

### Authentication Header
Pass your key in the `Authorization` header using the `Token` prefix.

```bash title="Example: Get User Profile"
curl -X GET https://app.iqra.bot/api/v1/user \
  -H "Authorization: Token iqra_sk_12345abcdef" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

<Callout type="error" title="Keep it Secret">
  Never expose your API Key in client-side code (browsers, mobile apps). Always make API requests from your backend server or use our [Middleware](/developers/sdks/middleware).
