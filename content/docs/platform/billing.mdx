Iqra AI operates on a **Hybrid Pricing Model**. This combines the stability of a monthly subscription with the flexibility of a pre-paid credit balance.

## The Credit System

Your account functions like a digital wallet. You have a **Credit Balance** displayed in the Billing Overview.

*   **Top-ups:** You add funds to your balance via credit card.
*   **Deductions:** Real-time costs (like phone calls or LLM token generation) are deducted from this balance as they happen.

<Callout type="error" title="Zero Balance">
  If your credit balance drops to zero (or below the threshold), **active calls may be terminated** and new calls will fail. We highly recommend configuring [Auto-Refill](#auto-refill) to prevent this.
</Callout>

## Feature Types

In the **Billing Overview**, you will see your features split into two categories. Understanding the difference is key to estimating costs.

### 1. Usage-Based Features (Consumables)
These are features that you "consume" by the minute or unit. Your Subscription Plan usually includes a specific quota of these. Once the included quota is exhausted, overage costs are deducted from your Credit Balance.

| Feature | Description | Example Unit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Call Minutes** | Duration of calls (Inbound/Outbound). | Per Minute |
| **Concurrency** | How many calls can happen simultaneously. | Max Slots |
| **Storage** | Size of uploaded Knowledge Base documents. | MB/GB |

### 2. Recurring Features (Rentals)
These are fixed monthly costs for resources you "hold". These are charged automatically every month.

| Feature | Description | Billing Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phone Numbers** | Rented numbers (e.g., Twilio/Telnyx). | Monthly deduction per number. |
| **Whitelabeling** | The license to rebrand the platform. | Fixed monthly fee. |
| **Seats/Users** | Additional team members. | Fixed monthly fee per user. |

## Auto-Refill
**Preventing Service Interruption**

To ensure your agents never go offline due to insufficient funds, you can configure Auto-Refill. This triggers a payment automatically when your balance gets low.

<Steps>

### Locate Configuration
In the **Billing Tab**, scroll to the **Auto-Refill** card.

### Set Thresholds
You need to define two values:
1.  **If Balance Falls Below:** The safety trigger (e.g., $20).
2.  **Top Up Amount:** The amount to charge your card (e.g., $100).
</Step>

<Step>
### Select Payment Method
Choose which saved card to charge for these automatic transactions.

## Usage Analysis

While the Billing tab handles money, the **Usage Tab** handles data. It provides granular transparency into where your money is going.

### Usage Overview
A high-level dashboard showing cost trends over time.
*   **Filter:** View by Date Range (Last 7 days, Month, Year).
*   **Group By:** Segment data by Day, Month, or Business to see which Workspace is costing the most.

### Usage History
The detailed ledger. Every single event that costs money is logged here.
*   **Line Items:** Each call segment, each recurring charge deduction.
*   **Detail:** Shows exactly how many minutes/units were consumed and the specific cost applied.

This is the source of truth for auditing your expenses.

## Payment Methods

You can manage your credit cards in the **Payment Methods** section of the Billing tab.

*   **Adding a Card:** A small temporary charge may be made to verify the card authenticity. This is refunded immediately.
*   **Default Card:** One card must be selected as the default for Auto-refill and Subscription renewals.
