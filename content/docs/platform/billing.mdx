Iqra AI operates on a **Hybrid Pricing Model** designed for flexibility. It combines the stability of a monthly subscription (for access and base limits) with the scalability of a pre-paid credit balance (for usage).

## The Credit System

Think of your account as a digital wallet. You maintain a **Credit Balance** which is used to pay for consumption.

### Deduction Logic (Post-Call)
Unlike prepaid phones that cut you off mid-sentence, Iqra AI prioritizes the customer experience.
1.  **Usage Occurs:** A call is made, Conversation Minutes/Voicemail Detection/Etc are consumed.
2.  **Calculation:** Once the session ends, the total cost is calculated based on your plan's unit price.
3.  **Deduction:** The cost is deducted from your balance.

<Callout type="warn" title="Negative Balances">
  Because deductions happen *after* the activity finishes, it is possible for your balance to go **negative** (e.g., if a long call exceeds your remaining $1.00).
  
  Services will be paused immediately after a negative balance is detected until you top up to a positive balance.
</Callout>

## Subscription Components

Your Plan consists of two distinct types of charges.

### 1. Recurring Features (Rentals)
These are fixed monthly costs for assets you "hold".
*   **Examples:** Phone Numbers, Whitelabel License, User Seats.
*   **Billing:** Charged automatically to your default card on your monthly renewal date.

### 2. Usage-Based Features (Consumables)
These are variable costs for activity (Minutes, Tokens, Storage).
*   **Included Quota:** Most plans come with a "Free Allowance" (e.g., 500 Minutes). Usage is drawn from here first.
*   **Pay-As-You-Go:** Once your included quota is exhausted, further usage is deducted from your **Credit Balance** at the unit price defined in your plan.

## Payment Methods

We support major Credit and Debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex).

### Add a New Card
1.  Navigate to **Billing** -> **Payment Methods**.
2.  Click **Add Payment Method**.
3.  Enter your card details securely.
</Step>

<Step>
### Verification Charge
To ensure the card is valid, our payment processor initiates a small **Temporary Hold** (approx $1.00).
*   **Note:** This is **not** a charge. It is immediately voided/refunded.
</Step>

### Set as Default
If you have multiple cards, you must mark one as **Default**. This card will be used for:

## Auto-Refill
**Preventing Service Interruption**

To ensure your agents never go offline due to a low balance, we highly recommend configuring **Auto-Refill**.

1.  Navigate to the **Billing Overview**.
2.  Scroll to the **Auto-Refill** card.
3.  **Threshold:** Set the trigger amount (e.g., *"If balance falls below $20"*).
4.  **Top Up Amount:** Set the refill amount (e.g., *"Add $100"*).
5.  Toggle the switch to **ON**.

## Billing History & Invoices

The **Billing History** tab provides a comprehensive audit trail of all financial transactions.

*   **Statuses:**
    *   `Paid`: Successful transaction.
    *   `Failed`: Card declined or error.
    *   `Checkout`: A payment session was started but not completed.
*   **Invoices:** Click on any `Paid` transaction to view details and download an official **PDF Receipt** for your accounting.
