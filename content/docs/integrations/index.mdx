Iqra AI is designed as an **Orchestration Layer**. We do not build the LLMs or the Telephone networks; we connect them. This **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** approach allows you to negotiate your own rates directly with providers like Azure or Twilio and maintain full control over your infrastructure.

To use any of these integrations, you will need to create an account with the provider and obtain an **API Key** or **Credentials**.

## Adding an Integration

Once you have your credentials ready, navigate to your **Business Dashboard** -> **Integrations** tab to add them.

<Callout type="info" title="Scope">
  Integrations are scoped to the **Business**. If you manage multiple businesses, you must add the integration to each one separately (or use different keys for billing separation).
