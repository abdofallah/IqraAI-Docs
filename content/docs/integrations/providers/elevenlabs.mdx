**ElevenLabs** is widely considered the gold standard for AI speech synthesis. It offers extremely human-like intonation, emotion, and clarity.

For Voice AI agents, we specifically utilize their **Turbo** models to minimize latency while maintaining high fidelity.

## Configuring Voices

Once connected, you don't just "turn on" ElevenLabs. You must select a specific **Voice** for your Agent.

### Finding Voice IDs
Iqra AI automatically fetches your available voices from ElevenLabs, but understanding the source helps.

1.  In ElevenLabs, go to the **VoiceLab**.
2.  You can use **Pre-made voices** or **Clone** your own voice.
3.  Every voice has a unique **Voice ID** (e.g., `21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM`).

When configuring your [Agent Intelligence](/build/agent/intelligence), simply select the voice name from the dropdown.

### Recommended Models

Latency is the enemy of Voice AI. Choosing the wrong model can add 1-2 seconds of delay.

<Cards>
  <Card icon={<Gauge />} title="Eleven Turbo v2.5">
    **Highly Recommended.** The fastest model available. Optimized specifically for low-latency conversational AI. It supports multiple languages but prioritizes speed.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Globe />} title="Eleven Multilingual v2">
    **High Quality.** Better accent handling for non-English languages, but slightly higher latency than Turbo. Use this if Turbo sounds unnatural for your specific language.

<Callout type="warn" title="Billing Warning">
  ElevenLabs charges by the character. Voice AI agents can consume characters very quickly during conversation. We recommend setting up **[Audio Caching](/build/agent/optimization#audio-caching)** in Iqra AI to save costs on repetitive phrases (like greetings).
