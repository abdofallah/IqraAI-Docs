<Cards>
  <Card icon={<Zap />} title="Gemini 1.5 Flash">
    **Recommended for Voice.** Extremely fast inference speed and low cost. Ideal for real-time conversation where latency is the priority.

<Callout type="tip" title="Safety Settings">
  Google models have strict safety filters by default. If your agent discusses sensitive topics (e.g., medical procedures), you may need to adjust the safety threshold in your Agent Configuration to prevent refusal of service.
