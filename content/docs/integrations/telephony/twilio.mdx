Twilio is a leading cloud communications platform. Iqra AI integrates seamlessly with Twilio to provision phone numbers and manage call routing.

## Prerequisites

Before connecting, ensure you have:
*   A Twilio Account.
*   A **Twilio Phone Number** purchased and active in your Twilio console.
*   Your **Twilio Account SID** and **Auth Token**.

## Getting Credentials

1.  **Log in** to your [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console).
2.  **Account SID & Auth Token:** These are prominently displayed on the main **Dashboard** page. Copy both values.
3.  **Phone Numbers:** Navigate to **Phone Numbers** > **Manage** > **Active Numbers**. Find the number you want to use with Iqra AI.

## Connecting to Iqra AI

1.  Navigate to **Business Dashboard** > **Integrations**.
2.  Click **Add Integration** > **Twilio**.
3.  **Name:** Give your integration a recognizable name (e.g., "My Twilio Account").
4.  **Account SID:** Paste your Twilio Account SID.
5.  **Auth Token:** Paste your Twilio Auth Token.
6.  **Default Number:** Select the primary Twilio number that will be used for this business. (This can be overridden in campaign routing).
7.  Click **Save Integration**.

## Webhook Configuration

This is the most crucial step for Twilio to work with Iqra AI. It tells Twilio where to send call events.

### Automatic Configuration
When you save your Twilio integration, Iqra AI attempts to automatically configure the **Voice Request URL** for your Twilio number. It also attempts to set up the **Status Callback URL**.

*   **If Successful:** You should see a green checkmark next to your number in the Iqra AI "Numbers" tab.
*   **If Failed:** You may see a warning, indicating manual setup is required.

### Manual Configuration (If Auto-Fails)
If the automatic setup doesn't work, or if you prefer manual control:

1.  **Find the Iqra AI Webhook URL:**
    *   Go to **Business Dashboard** > **Numbers**.
    *   Find your Twilio number in the list.
    *   Copy the **Voice Request URL** provided. It will look like: `https://<region-server>.iqra.bot/webhooks/twilio` (e.g., `https://eu-1.sip.iqra.bot/webhooks/twilio`).
2.  **Configure Twilio:**
    *   In your Twilio Console, navigate to **Phone Numbers** > **Manage** > **Active Numbers**.
    *   Click on your specific phone number.
    *   Scroll down to the **Voice & Fax** section.
    *   For **"A CALL COMES IN"**, select **Webhook** and paste the Iqra AI Voice Request URL you copied.
    *   Ensure the HTTP Method is set to **HTTP POST**.
    *   **Status Callback URL:** It's good practice to also set the **"Status Callback URL"** to the same Iqra AI webhook URL.
    *   Click **Save**.
