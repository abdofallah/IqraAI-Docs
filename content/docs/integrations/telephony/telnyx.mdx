</Step>

<Step>
### Assign Number to App
1.  Go to **Numbers** -> **My Numbers**.

4.  Click **Save**.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<Callout type="warn" title="Emergency Address (e911)">
  Telnyx (and regulations) often require you to associate an Emergency Address with your phone number before it becomes fully active for outbound calling. Check the "My Numbers" tab in Telnyx for any warnings.
</Callout>

*   **Call Fails Immediately:** Check if the **Connection/Application** is correctly assigned to the number.
*   **Latency:** Ensure your Telnyx Application "Anchor" region matches your Iqra AI "Route Server" region.
