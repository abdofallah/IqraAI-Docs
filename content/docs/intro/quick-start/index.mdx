Before you can make a phone call or deploy a web agent, you need to build the **Core Intelligence**. This guide covers setting up the "Brain" (AI Models), the "Persona" (Agent), and the "Logic" (Script).

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, ensure you have API keys for your preferred AI providers:
*   **LLM (Brain):** GroqCloud, Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, Google Gemini.
*   **TTS (Voice):** ElevenLabs, Deepgram, Azure Speech.
*   **STT (Ears):** Deepgram, Azure Speech.

<Callout type="warn" title="Infrastructure First">
  If you are **Self-Hosting**, ensure you have registered these providers in the [Admin Dashboard](/developers/admin/services) first. If you are using **Iqra Cloud**, they are pre-configured; you just need your API keys.
