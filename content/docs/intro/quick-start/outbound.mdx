Now that you have an [Agent and Script](/intro/quick-start), let's give it a voice on the telephone network.

Iqra AI uses a **BYOC (Bring Your Own Carrier)** model. You connect your own Twilio, Telnyx, or SIP account. This gives you full control over your phone numbers and billing rates.

## Prerequisites

*   A **Twilio** or **Telnyx** account with a purchased phone number.
*   **Account SID** and **Auth Token** (or API Key) from your carrier.

### Connect Telephony Integration

2.  Click **Add Integration** → Select **Twilio** (or your preferred provider).
3.  Enter your **Account SID** and **Auth Token**.
4.  **Default Number:** (Optional) Select a number to use as default.

### Add Phone Number & Region

We need to register the number in Iqra AI to handle routing.

1.  Go to the **Numbers Tab**.
2.  Click **Add Number**.
3.  **Provider:** Select the integration you just added.
4.  **Number:** Enter the number in **E.164 format** (e.g., `+1234567890`).
5.  **Route Server (Critical):** Select the region closest to where this number is based (e.g., `US-East` for a US number).

### Create Outbound Campaign

A "Campaign" links your Agent to a phone number strategy.

1.  Go to **Routing** → **Outbound Campaigns**.
2.  Click **Add Campaign**.
3.  **Agent:** Select the "Iqra" agent you created.
4.  **Script:** Select your script.
5.  **Number Strategy:** Select your Twilio integration.
6.  **Voicemail Detection:** Leave as default (Enabled) for now.
7.  Save the Campaign.

  **[Outbound campaigns](/build/campaigns/outbound)** are powerful. Learn how to configure **[Voicemail Detection (AMD)](/build/campaigns/outbound#voicemail-detection)** and **[Retry Logic](/build/campaigns/outbound#retry-logic)** for busy signals.

### Launch the Call

The moment of truth.

1.  Click the **Make Calls** button (Top Right or Sidebar).
2.  Select **Single Call**.
3.  **Campaign:** Select the campaign you just created.
4.  **To Number:** Enter your personal mobile number.
5.  Click **Launch Call**.

**What happens next?**
1.  Your phone will ring.
2.  When you pick up, the AI will detect your voice (or silence).
3.  It will speak the greeting defined in your Agent: *"Hello! Thanks for calling Medina Dental..."*

<Callout type="tip" title="Going Big?">
  The **[Make Calls](/build/operations/manual-calls)** tool also supports **[Bulk CSV Uploads](/build/operations/manual-calls#bulk-calls-csv-upload)**. You can upload a spreadsheet of 10,000 leads, map columns to script variables (e.g. `{{ Name }}`), and launch a mass campaign instantly.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Call Failed immediately?** Check the **Logs** tab. If the error is `Provider Error`, check your Twilio/Telnyx Geo-Permissions or credit balance.
*   **Latency is high?** Check if your **Phone Number Region**, **Iqra Route Server**, and **AI Integrations (LLM/TTS)** are all in the same geographic region (e.g., all in US East).
