Now that you have an [Agent and Script](/intro/quick-start), let's set up a digital receptionist.

**Inbound Routing** allows you to connect a phone number to an Agent. It also handles the initial handshake, such as asking the user for their preferred language ("Press 1 for English") before the AI takes over.

## Prerequisites

*   A **Twilio**, **Telnyx**, or **SIP** account with a purchased phone number.
*   **Account SID** and **Auth Token** (or API Key).

<Steps>
<Step>
### Connect Telephony & Add Number

If you haven't already connected your carrier:

1.  Navigate to **Business Dashboard** → **Integrations**.
2.  Add your **Twilio** or **Telnyx** integration.
3.  Go to the **Numbers Tab** and click **Add Number**.
4.  Enter your number in **E.164 format** (e.g., `+1234567890`) and select the **Route Server Region**.

<Callout type="warn" title="Webhook Configuration">
  For Inbound calls to work, your carrier must send the call to Iqra AI.
  *   **Twilio/Telnyx:** We attempt to auto-configure the webhook when you save the number.
  *   **SIP/Others:** You must manually copy the **Webhook URL** displayed in the Numbers list and paste it into your carrier's portal.

### Create Inbound Route

The "Route" is the logic that decides who picks up the phone.

1.  Go to **Routing** → **Inbound Routing**.
2.  Click **Add Route**.
3.  **Number:** Select the phone number you added in Step 1.
4.  **Agent:** Select your "Iqra" agent.
5.  **Script:** Select your script.

<Callout type="info" title="Deep Dive">
  **[Inbound Routes](/build/campaigns/inbound)** are powerful. You can configure **[Webhooks & Actions](/build/campaigns/inbound#actions)** to trigger external tools (like a CRM update) immediately when the phone rings or when the call ends.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Language (IVR)

Iqra AI features a built-in **Programmatic IVR**.

*   **Single Language:** If you only enable "English", the Agent picks up immediately.
*   **Multi-Language:** If you add "English" and "Arabic", the system automatically plays: *"Press 1 for English. Press 2 for Arabic."*

For this test, stick to **Single Language** (English) for the fastest pickup time.
</Step>

<Step>
### The Test

1.  Pick up your personal phone.
2.  Dial the business number you configured.
3.  **Ring... Ring...**
4.  The system should answer, and your Agent should speak the greeting: *"Hello! Thanks for calling..."*

</Step>
</Steps>

## Real-time Monitoring

While on the call, you can watch the "Brain" work in real-time.

1.  Open the **Conversations Tab** in your dashboard.
2.  You will see a row with status **Active**.
3.  Click on it to see the live transcript as you speak.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Busy Signal?** This usually means the **Webhook** failed.
    *   Check your Twilio/Telnyx console. Ensure the "Voice URL" is pointing to `https://.../webhooks/twilio`.
    *   Ensure you have credits in your Iqra AI account (if using Cloud).
*   **Silence after pickup?** This is often a **Region Mismatch**. Ensure your Number, Route Server, and TTS Provider are in the same region (e.g., US-East).
