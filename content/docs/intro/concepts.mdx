To build on Iqra AI, you need to understand the relationship between the "Persona" (Agent) and the "Logic" (Script), as well as the building blocks available to you.

## Agents vs. Scripts
**Separating Personality from Logic**

Iqra AI decouples the "Who" from the "What."

1.  **The Agent (The Persona):** Defines the Voice, Tone, Language, and Interruption behavior.
2.  **The Script (The Logic):** A visual graph that defines the capabilities, tools, and conversation flow.

*Benefit:* You can have one "Sales Script" used by 50 different Agents (with different voices/accents) simultaneously.

## Script Components

The Script is more than just a conversation tree; it is a full orchestration map.

  <Card icon={<Variable />} title="Variables (State)" href="/build/script/variables">
    **Memory.** Store data (e.g., `user_name`, `booking_count`) during the conversation.
    *   **Visible:** Data the AI can see and use.
    *   **Hidden:** Secure flags used for internal logic only.
  </Card>
  
  <Card icon={<Blocks />} title="FlowApps (Plugins)" href="/build/script/flowapps">
    **Integrations.** Pre-built connections to external apps (Cal.com, HubSpot). Unlike generic API nodes, these provide a rich UI with dynamic dropdowns and validation.
  </Card>
  
  <Card icon={<GitFork />} title="Action Flows" href="/build/script/action-flows">
    **Logic Engine.** A group of nodes that execute deterministic logic. When the AI enters an Action Flow, it follows a strict path (If/Else, Loops) until completion.
  </Card>
  
  <Card icon={<Shield />} title="Secure Sessions" href="/build/script/secure-sessions">
    **Security.** A "Clean Room" mode where the AI is muted. The system takes control to collect PII/PCI data (Credit Cards, SSNs) via DTMF/Voice, ensuring the LLM never sees the secrets.
  </Card>

  <Card icon={<Wrench />} title="System Capabilities" href="/build/script/nodes">
    **Native Tools.** Built-in platform capabilities available in the graph:
    *   **Telephony:** Get DTMF Input, Transfer Call, End Call.
    *   **Messaging:** Send SMS.
    *   **Context:** Retrieve Business Data (Products/Services).
    *   **Control:** Change Language, Go To Node.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Native Multi-Language
**Localization over Translation**

Iqra AI is built to be Polyglot. We do not rely on fragile real-time translation layers. You define specific prompts, responses, and logic for each language (e.g., English & Arabic) within the same agent.

<Callout type="info" title="Visual Cue: The Language Icon">
  <Globe className="w-4 h-4 inline-block mr-2" />
  Whenever you see the **Globe/Language Icon** next to an input field (like "Prompt" or "AI Response"), it means you must provide content for **every language** enabled in your Business Settings.

## Latency & Regions
**Mastering the Speed of Light**

Voice AI requires sub-second responses. To achieve this, physical distance matters.

*   **Multi-Region Strategy:** You can route a EU Phone Number to be processed by our EU Servers using AI Providers hosted in the EU.
*   **Edge Computing:** By processing the "Brain" close to the "User," we eliminate trans-continental lag.

## Templating (Scriban)
**Dynamic Data Injection**

We use the **Scriban** engine to inject variables into your prompts, SMS messages, and API payloads.

*   **Syntax:** `{{ variable_name }}`
*   **Example:** `Hello {{ contact.first_name }}, your code is {{ session.otp }}.`

<Callout type="tip" title="Visual Cue: The Braces">
  <Braces className="w-4 h-4 inline-block mr-2" />
  Look for the **Braces Icon** in input labels. This indicates that the field supports dynamic templating. Typing `{{` in these fields will trigger an autocomplete menu.
