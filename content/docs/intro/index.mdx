# What is Iqra AI?

**Iqra AI** is a comprehensive, low-code platform designed to build, deploy, and manage Voice AI Agents. Created by [Badal Technologies](https://www.badal.om) in the Sultanate of Oman, it serves as the bridge between raw LLM intelligence and real-world telephony requirements.

Unlike simple wrappers that hide functionality behind a single prompt box, Iqra AI is an **Orchestration Engine**. We provide a visual interface for complex logic while exposing deep-level controls—allowing you to manage latency, interruption behavior, and conversation flow with precision.

  Iqra AI is open-source at heart! You can access the core engine on [GitHub](https://github.com/abdofallah/IqraAI).

## Core Philosophies

Iqra AI was built to solve specific challenges in the Voice AI space: **Latency**, **Localization**, and **Control**.

  <Card icon={<Globe />} title="Native Multi-Language" href="/intro/concepts#multi-language">
    Don't rely on auto-translation. Define specific prompts, logic, and integrations for each language (e.g., English & Arabic) within a single agent to ensure grammatical accuracy and cultural relevance.
  </Card>
  
  <Card icon={<Zap />} title="Multi-Region Latency" href="/intro/concepts#multi-region">
    You control the physics. Select specific regions for your phone numbers and processing servers to ensure your TTS, STT, and LLM are physically close, minimizing delay.
  </Card>
  
  <Card icon={<Share2 />} title="Graph-Based Logic" href="/build/script">
    Separate "Personality" from "Logic". Build complex flows using our Node Graph—handle user queries, execute tools, and branch logic visually.
  </Card>
  
  <Card icon={<Layers />} title="Agency & Enterprise" href="/platform/whitelabel">
    Built for scale. Features a robust Whitelabeling system, allowing agencies to rebrand the platform, manage customer billing, and create custom subscription plans.
