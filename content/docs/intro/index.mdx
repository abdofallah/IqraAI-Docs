# What is Iqra AI?

**Iqra AI** is an open-source orchestration platform designed to build, deploy, and manage intelligent Conversational Agents. Created by [Badal Technologies](https://www.badal.om) in the Sultanate of Oman, it serves as the operating system for the next generation of AI applications.

Unlike simple wrappers that treat AI as a chatbot, Iqra AI is a **Hybrid Computing Engine**. It allows you to harness the dynamic, human-like understanding of LLMs while enforcing the strict, deterministic reliability of code through our **Visual Script Builder** with **FlowApp** and **Action Flow** systems.

We enable you to build "Superhuman Employees"—agents that can think dynamically to understand a customer, but act systematically to update your database, process payments, or book appointments without error.

<Callout type="info" title="Open Source">
  Iqra AI is open-source at heart! The complete technical stack (Frontend, Backend, Proxy, Workers) is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/abdofallah/IqraAI).

## Core Philosophies

We built Iqra AI to solve the "Enterprise AI Gap": balancing the need for creative intelligence with the requirement for data control and business logic.

<Cards>
  <Card icon={<Workflow />} title="Hybrid Orchestration" href="/intro/philosophy">
    **Probabilistic + Deterministic.** The AI handles the conversation flow, but **Action Flows** and **FlowApps** handle the business logic. This ensures your agent never "hallucinates" a bank transfer or a calendar booking.
  </Card>

  <Card icon={<MessageSquare />} title="Multi-Channel Native" href="/build/campaigns">
    **Build once, deploy everywhere.** Orchestrate conversations across **Telephony** (PSTN/SIP), **Web** (Real-time WebRTC), and **Chat** interfaces using a single logic graph.
  </Card>
  
  <Card icon={<Zap />} title="Latency & Region Control" href="/intro/concepts#multi-region">
    **Master the Speed of Light.** We provide deep infrastructure control, allowing you to route calls and process inference in specific geographic regions (Edge Computing) to achieve &lt;1s voice latency.
  </Card>
  
  <Card icon={<Globe />} title="Native Polyglot" href="/intro/concepts#multi-language">
    **Localization over Translation.** Define specific prompts, logic, and integrations for each language (e.g., English & Arabic) to ensure cultural nuance and grammatical accuracy.
  </Card>

### Open Source (Self-Hosted)
The complete technology stack available for developers and enterprises with data sovereignty requirements.
*   **The Full Engine:** Includes the **Frontend** (Dashboard), **Backend** (Audio/Logic Processor), **Proxy** (Telephony Gateway), and **Background Workers**.
*   **Exclusions:** Does *not* include the Multi-Tenant SaaS Billing system or Whitelabel management tools.
