In this guide, we will set up a fully functional outbound Voice AI agent. We will create a **Business**, connect your **AI Providers**, and make a **Test Call** to your own phone.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, ensure you have API keys for the following services:
*   **LLM:** OpenAI or Azure.
*   **TTS (Text-to-Speech):** ElevenLabs, Azure, or OpenAI.
*   **STT (Speech-to-Text):** Deepgram or Azure.
*   **Telephony:** Twilio, Telnyx, or Vonage (for the phone number).

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create a Business Workspace

Everything in Iqra AI happens inside a **Business**.

1.  Navigate to the **Businesses Tab** in your User Dashboard.
2.  Click **Add Business**.
3.  Give it a name (e.g., "My First Agency") and upload a logo if desired.
4.  Click on the newly created business card to enter the **Business Dashboard**.

</Step>

<Step>
### Connect Integrations

We need to give the agent its capabilities. Go to the **Integrations Tab** in the Business Dashboard.

1.  **LLM:** Click **Add Integration** → Select **OpenAI** → Paste your API Key.
2.  **STT:** Click **Add Integration** → Select **Deepgram** → Paste your API Key.
3.  **TTS:** Click **Add Integration** → Select **ElevenLabs** → Paste your API Key.
4.  **Telephony:** Click **Add Integration** → Select **Twilio** → Add your Account SID and Auth Token.

  You can use different providers if you prefer (e.g., Azure for everything), but this combination usually offers the best balance of quality and latency.

</Step>

<Step>
### Create the Agent (The Persona)

Now, let's define *who* is speaking. Go to the **Agents Tab**.

1.  Click **Add Agent**.
2.  **General:** Name it "Sarah".
3.  **Personality:** Enter "You are a helpful receptionist for a dental clinic."
4.  **Integrations:** Select the integrations you added in the previous step for English.
5.  **Utterances:** Set **Agent Speaks First** to `ON` and set the greeting to: *"Hello, thanks for calling Medina Dental, how can I help you?"*
6.  Save the Agent.

</Step>

<Step>
### Create the Script (The Logic)

We need to tell the agent *how* to handle the conversation. Go to the **Scripts Tab**.

1.  Click **Add Script**.
2.  In the Graph Editor, you will see a **Start Node**.
3.  Right-click the canvas to add nodes:
    *   Add a **User Query** node (e.g., "Book Appointment").
    *   Add an **AI Response** node (e.g., "Sure, what time works for you?").
    *   Connect the **Start Node** to the **User Query** node.
4.  Save the Script.

*Note: For a simple test, you can leave the script empty or minimal; the LLM will handle general conversation based on the personality defined in the Agent.*

</Step>

<Step>
### Setup Routing

Before we call, we need to link the Agent to a Campaign or Route.

1.  Go to **Telephony Campaigns**.
2.  Create a new Campaign.
3.  Select "Sarah" as the **Agent** and your new script as the **Script**.
4.  Select your Twilio integration/number in **Number Route**.

</Step>

<Step>
### Make a Call

The moment of truth. Let's trigger a call manually from the dashboard.

1.  Click the **Make Calls** button in the sidebar (or header actions).
2.  Select **Single Call**.
3.  **Campaign:** Select the campaign you just created.
4.  **Phone Number:** Enter your personal phone number (with country code).
5.  Click **Launch Call**.

Your phone should ring within a few seconds. Answer it, and speak to your new AI agent!
