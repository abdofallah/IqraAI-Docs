The **Admin Dashboard** is a restricted interface designed for the **Platform Owner**.

If you are **Self-Hosting** Iqra AI, you will spend significant time here during the initial setup. This dashboard allows you to define the physical topology of your deployment (Servers & Regions) and the logical capabilities of your platform (Integrations & Services).

<Callout type="error" title="Access Control">
  This dashboard grants full control over the platform's infrastructure. Ensure only trusted administrators have access roles.

## Why is this needed?

Iqra AI is a **Distributed System**. The code (Backend App) needs to know about the Database, and the Database needs to know where the code is running.

1.  **Infrastructure Discovery:** If you deploy a new Backend Server in "London", the Proxy doesn't magically know it exists. You must register it here so the Load Balancer includes it in the rotation.
2.  **Dynamic Integrations:** When you add support for a new LLM provider in the code, you must register it here so users can see it in their dropdown menus.

## Core Modules

    **Topology.** Define **Regions** (e.g., US-East, EU-Central) and register the **Proxy** and **Backend** servers running in those regions.
  </Card>
  
  <Card icon={<Plug />} title="Service Registry" href="/developers/admin/services">
    **Capabilities.** Map the C# Service classes (e.g., `GroqCloudLLMService`) to user-facing Integration options. Configure default API keys and global limits.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Operational Management

Beyond setup, the Admin Dashboard provides oversight for the running platform.

*   **User Management:** View, edit, or ban users across the entire platform.
*   **Business Oversight:** Access any Business Workspace for debugging or support purposes.
*   **Global Settings:** Configure platform-wide variables (SMTP settings, S3 Storage credentials).
