The **App** tab allows you to control the global behavior of the Iqra AI platform. This is where you manage access policies and communication standards.

## Global Permissions

These are the "Circuit Breakers" for your platform. Changes here take effect immediately across all users and regions.

### 1. Maintenance Mode
<Callout type="error" title="Critical Switch">
  Enabling **Maintenance Mode** effectively shuts down the platform for end-users.
</Callout>

*   **Effect:**
    *   **Dashboard:** Non-admin users cannot log in. They see a "Under Maintenance" screen.
    *   **Traffic:** The Proxy stops accepting *new* Inbound/Outbound calls.
    *   **Admins:** You can still log in to the Admin Dashboard to perform updates.
*   **Use Case:** Database migrations, version upgrades, or emergency patching.

### 2. Disable Registration
*   **Effect:** The `/register` page button is disabled. Users cannot create new accounts.
*   **Use Case:** Running a **Private Instance** (Invite-only).
*   **Note:** Existing users can still log in.

### 3. Disable Login
*   **Effect:** Prevents users from logging into their dashboards. Active sessions may persist until token expiry.
*   **Use Case:** Security freeze or investigating a platform-wide breach.

## Email Templates

Iqra AI sends transactional emails for account security. You can fully customize the branding and HTML structure of these emails.

Navigate to **App** -> **Email Templates**.

### Supported Templates
1.  **Verify Email:** Sent upon registration. Contains the activation link.
2.  **Welcome User:** Sent after successful verification.
3.  **Reset Password:** Sent when a user requests a password recovery.

### The Editor
We provide a raw **HTML Editor**. You can paste your own responsive email design (e.g., from MJML or Mailchimp export).

**Variables:**
You can inject dynamic data using the variable syntax shown below the editor.

| Template | Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Verify Email** | `{{VERIFY_URL}}` | The unique, time-sensitive verify link the user must click. |
| **Welcome User** | `{{USER_NAME}}` | The user's display name. |
| **Reset Password** | `{{RESET_URL}}` | The unique, time-sensitive reset link the user must click. |
