We are actively expanding the Iqra AI ecosystem. While our core infrastructure is built on .NET and our web widget is pure JavaScript, we understand that developers work in many environments.

## Server-Side Libraries (Roadmap)

We plan to release official middleware and API wrapper libraries for the following languages:

<Cards>
  <Card icon={<Terminal />} title="Python">
    **FastAPI / Flask / Django.**
    *   Planned: Native middleware for handling webhooks and rate-limiting.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Terminal />} title="Node.js">
    **Express / NestJS.**
    *   Planned: TypeScript-first SDK for backend integration.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Terminal />} title="Go & Rust">
    **High Performance.**
    *   Planned: Lightweight clients for microservices architecture.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Mobile SDKs

Bringing Voice AI to native applications.

<Cards>
  <Card icon={<Smartphone />} title="Cross-Platform">
    **React Native & Flutter.**
    *   Components to easily embed the "Talk" button into hybrid apps.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Code2 />} title="Native">
    **Swift (iOS) & Kotlin (Android).**
    *   Deep integration with native audio subsystems for background processing.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Generating Your Own Client

You do not have to wait for us!

Iqra AI follows the **OpenAPI 3.0** standard. You can generate a client library for *any* language instantly using our [API Reference](/api-reference) and tools like `openapi-generator`.

```bash
# Example: Generating a Python client
openapi-generator-cli generate -i https://app.iqra.bot/api/v1/swagger.json -g python -o ./iqra-python-client
```
