Congratulations! Your containers are running and your backend service is active. However, the platform is currently a "Blank Slate".

You must now log in to the **Admin Dashboard** to tell the system about your infrastructure topology and available AI services.

## 1. Accessing the Admin Panel

Navigate to your frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost` or `https://app.your-domain.com`).

1.  Click **Login**.
2.  Use the **Default Admin Credentials** defined in your `IqraFrontend/appsettings.json`.

```json
"Admin": {
  "DefaultEmail": "admin@localhost.com",
  "DefaultPassword": "AdminPassword123!"
}
```

<Callout type="error" title="Security Risk">
  **Change your password immediately** after the first login via the Profile settings.
</Callout>

## 2. Registering Infrastructure

The database needs to know where your servers are running so it can route calls.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create a Region
1.  Go to **Admin Dashboard** -> **Infrastructure** -> **Regions**.
2.  Click **Add Region**.
3.  **Name:** `Default Region`.
4.  **Identifier:** `us-east-1` (or your preferred code).
</Step>

<Step>
### Register Proxy
1.  Select the Region.
2.  Add Server -> **Type: Proxy**.
3.  **URL:** The internal docker address (e.g., `http://proxy:8080`) or public URL.
4.  **Secret:** Paste the `ApiSecretToken` you set in `appsettings.json`.
</Step>

<Step>
### Register Backend
1.  Add Server -> **Type: Backend**.
2.  **URL:** The address of your native backend service (e.g., `http://10.0.0.5:5000`).
3.  **Secret:** Paste the `ApiSecretToken`.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Seeding the Service Registry

The platform supports "OpenAI", but the database doesn't know that yet. You must map the C# Classes to UI Definitions.

<Callout type="info" title="Automatic Sync (Coming Soon)">
  In future updates, we will provide an "Install Wizard" that syncs the latest service definitions from the Iqra Cloud repository automatically. For now, this is a manual process.
</Callout>

### Example: Adding OpenAI Support

1.  Navigate to **Admin Dashboard** -> **Integrations**.
2.  Create a new Integration Type:
    *   **Name:** `OpenAI`
    *   **Tags:** `LLM`, `TTS`
    *   **Config Schema:** `{"ApiKey": "text"}`
3.  Navigate to **Services**.
4.  Create a new Service:
    *   **Name:** `OpenAI GPT`
    *   **Type:** `LLM`
    *   **Service Key:** `OpenAILLMService` (**Critical:** Must match C# Class Name exactly).
    *   **Link Integration:** Select `OpenAI`.

Repeat this for every provider you wish to support (ElevenLabs, Deepgram, Twilio, etc.).

## 4. Verification

To verify the entire stack is operational:

1.  **Create User:** Go to the User Dashboard and sign up a new standard user.
2.  **Create Business:** Create a workspace.
3.  **Add Integration:** Add a real OpenAI Key to the business.
4.  **Test Call:** Use the "Make Calls" button.

If the call connects, audio flows, and the AI responds, your self-hosted cluster is fully operational.
