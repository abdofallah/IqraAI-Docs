title: Self-Hosting Overview
description: Prerequisites and architectural considerations for deploying Iqra AI on your own infrastructure.

Self-hosting Iqra AI gives you absolute control over data privacy, latency, and infrastructure costs. However, unlike standard web applications, a Voice AI platform requires specific attention to **Audio Latency**, **UDP Networking**, and **Compute Performance**.

## Deployment Strategy

Iqra AI follows a **Hybrid Deployment Model**.

| Component | Recommended Host | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Layer** (Mongo/Redis/Milvus) | **Docker** | Easy management, standard images. |
| **Frontend / Proxy / Background** | **Docker** | Stateless web services, easy to containerize. |
| **Backend App** | **Bare Metal / VM** | Requires direct access to **UDP Ports** (10000-20000) for RTP audio streams. Docker networking (NAT) can introduce jitter or packet loss if not configured perfectly (e.g., Host Networking). |

<Callout type="warn" title="OS Compatibility">
  The platform is built on **.NET**. It runs natively on **Windows** (Windows 10 recommended/tested) and **Linux** (Debian 12+ recommended/tested). macOS is supported for development but not recommended for production as it has not been tested.
</Callout>

## System Requirements

### Hardware (Minimum)
*   **CPU:** 4 Cores (High clock speed preferred over core count for audio processing).
*   **RAM:** 8GB (Milvus and Redis are memory-intensive).
*   **Disk:** 50GB SSD (NVMe recommended for Vector DB performance).

### Network
*   **Public IP:** Essential for receiving Webhooks from Telephony providers.
*   **Ports:**
    *   `80/443` (HTTP/HTTPS) - Dashboard & API.
    *   `5060` (SIP) - If using SIP Trunking.
    *   `10000-20000` (UDP) - **Critical.** RTP Audio Media range.

## Software Dependencies

Before running the application code, you need the "Data Layer" up and running.
