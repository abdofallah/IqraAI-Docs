**FlowApps** are the plugin system of Iqra AI. They allow you to add complex capabilities—like booking a meeting, creating a CRM contact, or sending a Slack message—without writing a single line of API code.

Unlike generic [Custom Tools](/build/tools/custom-tools), FlowApps provide a **Native UI Experience**.

## Why use FlowApps?

<Cards>
  <Card icon={<ListFilter />} title="Dynamic Dropdowns">
    **No more ID hunting.** Instead of asking for a "Calendar ID", the node connects to your account and shows a dropdown of your available calendars.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Zap />} title="Validated Inputs">
    The node knows what is required (e.g., Email, Date). It validates your inputs before you save, preventing runtime errors.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Mic />} title="Latency Masking">
    APIs take time. FlowApps allow the agent to speak a filler phrase ("Let me check that for you...") *while* the tool is executing, eliminating dead air.
  </Card>

## Configuring a FlowApp Node

<Steps>
<Step>
### Add the Node
Drag your desired app (e.g., **Cal.com**) from the **Integrations** category in the Sidebar Palette onto the canvas.
</Step>

<Step>
### Select Action
Click the node. In the configuration panel, select the **Action** you want to perform (e.g., "Book a Meeting").
*   *Note:* The form below will change dynamically based on the action you choose.
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Inputs
You will see a list of fields required by the API. For each field, you have two choices:

**Option A: Static / Template (You define it)**
You provide the value. It can be a hardcoded string or a [Script Variable](/build/script/variables).
*   *Example:* `Email` -> `{{ variables.user_email }}`

**Option B: AI Generated (Agent defines it)**
You verify the checkbox **"AI Generated"**.
*   The system will instruct the LLM to extract this information from the conversation history.
*   *Example:* `Reason` -> The agent listens to the user and fills this field automatically.
</Step>

<Step>
### Select Credentials
If the app requires authentication (e.g., HubSpot), select the **Integration** account you connected in the [Integrations Tab](/build/tools/integrations).
*   *Public Apps:* Some apps (like Weather) do not require an account.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Features

### Smart Fetchers (Context Aware)
Some dropdowns are "Smart." They depend on other fields.

*   **Scenario:** You want to book a meeting.
*   **Step 1:** Select **User** (Dropdown lists your team members).
*   **Step 2:** Select **Event Type**.
    *   *Magic:* The Event Type dropdown automatically updates to show only events belonging to the *selected User*.

### Latency Masking (Speaking Before Execution)
External APIs can be slow. A 2-second delay feels like an eternity in a voice conversation.

Use the **Speaking Before Execution** field to mask this delay.
*   **Text:** *"One moment, let me see what times are available..."*
*   **Behavior:** The Agent starts speaking this text *immediately*. While speaking, the system executes the API call in the background. By the time the agent finishes speaking, the data is ready.

<Callout type="warn" title="Multi-Language">
  If you use Latency Masking, remember to provide the filler phrase for **every language** enabled in your business.
</Callout>

### Output Mapping
When the FlowApp finishes, it returns data (e.g., `booking_id`, `status`).

You can map these results to **Script Variables** to use them later in the flow.
*   *Output:* `booking_id` -> *Map to Variable:* `my_booking_ref`
*   *Usage:* In a later SMS node, use `Your ref is {{ variables.my_booking_ref }}`.
