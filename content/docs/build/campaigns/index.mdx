import { Route, PhoneIncoming, PhoneOutgoing, Globe, Webhook, Settings } from 'lucide-react';

An **Agent** and a **Script** are just code sitting on a server. To make them useful, you need to connect them to a communication channel.

**Routing** is the "Bridge" layer of Iqra AI. It defines the rules for how a conversation starts, which Agent handles it, and what happens when it ends.

## The Connection Logic

## Campaign Types

Iqra AI supports three distinct types of conversation flows.

<Cards>
  <Card icon={<PhoneIncoming />} title="Inbound Routing" href="/build/campaigns/inbound">

    *   **Features:** Multi-language IVR ("Press 1 for English"), Queue management, Fallback routing.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<PhoneOutgoing />} title="Outbound Campaigns" href="/build/campaigns/outbound">

## Shared Components

Regardless of the campaign type, you will need to manage the underlying infrastructure.

<Cards>
  <Card icon={<Settings />} title="Phone Numbers" href="/build/campaigns/numbers">
    Connect your **BYOC (Bring Your Own Carrier)** accounts like Twilio, Telnyx, or SIP Trunks. Configure region-specific routing for latency optimization.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Webhook />} title="Actions & Webhooks" href="/build/campaigns/inbound#actions">
    Trigger external APIs when specific events happen (e.g., Call Initiated, Call Ended, Call Failed).
  </Card>
