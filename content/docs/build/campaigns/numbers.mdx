Iqra AI operates on a **Bring Your Own Carrier (BYOC)** model. We do not sell phone numbers directly. Instead, you connect your existing accounts (Twilio, Telnyx, Vonage, or SIP Trunks) to our platform.

This gives you full ownership of your numbers and allows you to negotiate rates directly with carriers.

## Adding a Number

Navigate to **Business Dashboard** -> **Numbers**.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Select Provider
Choose the Integration account this number belongs to.
*   *Note:* You must have added the [Integration](/build/knowledge/integrations) first (e.g., connected your Twilio Account SID).
</Step>

<Step>
### Enter Number (DID)
Enter the phone number in **E.164 Format** (e.g., `+1234567890`).
*   Must include the `+` and Country Code.
*   Must match exactly what is in your carrier account.
</Step>

<Step>
### Select Route Server (Region)
**Critical for Latency.** You must define which Iqra AI server region handles calls for this specific number.

*   **Scenario:** You have a UK Phone Number (+44).
*   **Action:** Select the **London (EU)** Route Server.
*   **Result:** Audio packets travel a short distance between the UK Carrier and our UK Server.

If you route a UK number to a US Server, you introduce trans-atlantic latency (~150ms extra delay) for every turn of the conversation.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Webhook Configuration

When a call comes into your number, the Carrier (e.g., Twilio) needs to know where to send the audio. This is done via **Webhooks**.

### Automatic Configuration
For API-first providers like **Twilio** and **Telnyx**, Iqra AI attempts to automatically update the Voice URL settings for that number via their API when you save.

### Manual Configuration
If the auto-update fails, or if you are using **SIP Trunking** or **ModemTel**, you must configure this manually.

1.  In the Numbers list, look for the **Webhook URL** field next to your number.
2.  Copy the URL (e.g., `https://eu-1.sip.iqra.bot/webhooks/twilio`).
3.  Log in to your Carrier's dashboard (e.g., Twilio Console).
4.  Paste this URL into the **"A Call Comes In"** (Webhook) field.

## SIP Trunking

For SIP trunks, the setup is slightly different.

*   **SIP URI:** We provide a termination URI (e.g., `sip.iqra.bot`).
*   **Headers:** You may need to configure your SIP provider to pass the `To` and `From` headers correctly so we can identify the number.
*   **IP Whitelisting:** If your provider requires IP whitelisting, please refer to the [Integrations Guide](/integrations/telephony).

<Callout type="warn" title="Deleting Numbers">
  Removing a number from Iqra AI **does not** cancel it with your carrier. You will continue to be billed by Twilio/Telnyx until you release the number in their console.
