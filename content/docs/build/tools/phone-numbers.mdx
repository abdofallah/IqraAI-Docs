Iqra AI operates on a **Bring Your Own Carrier (BYOC)** model. We do not sell phone numbers directly. Instead, you connect your existing accounts (Twilio, Telnyx, Vonage, or SIP Trunks) to our platform.

This gives you full ownership of your numbers and allows you to negotiate rates directly with carriers.

## Adding a Number

Navigate to **Business Dashboard** -> **Phone Numbers**.

<Callout type="info" title="Provider Guides">
  Need specific instructions for your carrier? Check out the list of all providers at [Integrations Telephony](/integrations/telephony) which includes detailed guide for each available telephony provider.
  Quick guide access to commonly used providers:
  *   **[Twilio Setup](/integrations/telephony/twilio)**
  *   **[Telnyx Setup](/integrations/telephony/telnyx)**
  *   **[SIP Trunking](/integrations/telephony/sip-trunking)**
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
### Select Provider
Choose the Integration account this number belongs to.
*   *Note:* You must have added the [Integration](/build/tools/integrations) first.
</Step>

<Step>
### Enter Number (DID)
Enter the phone number in **E.164 Format** (e.g., `+1234567890`).
*   **Format:** Must include the `+` and Country Code.
*   **Match:** Must match exactly what is in your carrier account.
</Step>

<Step>
### Select Route Server (Region)
**Critical for Latency.** You must define which Iqra AI server region handles calls for this specific number.

*   **Scenario:** You have a UK Phone Number (+44).
*   **Action:** Select the **London (EU)** Route Server.
*   **Result:** Audio packets travel a short distance between the UK Carrier and our UK Server.

<Callout type="warn" title="Latency Penalty">
  If you route a UK number to a US Server, you introduce trans-atlantic latency (~150ms extra delay) for every turn of the conversation.
</Callout>
</Step>

## Webhook Configuration

When a call comes into your number, the Carrier (e.g., Twilio) needs to know where to send the audio. This is done via **Webhooks**.

### Automatic Configuration
For API-first providers like **Twilio** and **Telnyx**, Iqra AI attempts to automatically update the Voice URL settings for that number via their API when you save.

### Manual Configuration
If the auto-update fails, or if you are using **SIP Trunking**, you must configure this manually.

1.  In the Numbers list, locate your number.
2.  Click the **Webhook / Config** button in the **Actions** column.
3.  A popup will appear with provider-specific details:
    *   **Twilio/Telnyx:** Copy the `Voice Request URL`.
    *   **SIP Trunking:** Copy the `SIP URI` and `Header` requirements.
4.  Log in to your Carrier's dashboard and paste these values into the appropriate routing configuration.

## SIP Trunking

For SIP trunks, the setup often involves more than just a URL. The **Config Popup** will provide:

*   **SIP URI:** The termination address (e.g., `sip:your-number@sip.iqra.bot`).
*   **Headers:** Required SIP headers (e.g., `X-Business-ID`) for authentication.
*   **IP Whitelisting:** If your provider requires IP whitelisting, please refer to the [Integrations Guide](/integrations/telephony/sip-trunking) for our signaling and media subnets.

<Callout type="error" title="Deleting Numbers">
  Removing a number from Iqra AI **does not** cancel it with your carrier. You will continue to be billed by Twilio/Telnyx/Vonage until you release the number in their console.
