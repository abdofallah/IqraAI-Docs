Before you can build an Agent or connect a Phone Number, you must provide the infrastructure. The **Integrations Tab** acts as your workspace's **Key Vault**.

You store your credentials here once, and reuse them across multiple agents, scripts, and campaigns.

## Integration Categories

Iqra AI is vendor-agnostic. We support a wide range of providers across the entire stack.

## Concept: Connection vs. Configuration

It is important to understand the difference between adding an integration and using it.

| Concept | Location | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integration Account** | **Here (Integrations Tab)** | **The Credential.** You add your OpenAI API Key here. You give it a name (e.g., "My Prod Key"). |
| **Configuration** | **Agent Studio/Knowledge Base Studio/Etc** | **The Usage.** You select *which* model to use (e.g., GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5) and set parameters (Temperature). |

**Benefit:** You can add one OpenAI account, and use it to power 5 different Agents, each using a different model and temperature setting.

## Adding an Integration

Navigate to **Business Dashboard** -> **Integrations**.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Select Provider
Click **Add Integration**. You will see the library of supported services.
*   *Tip:* Use the tags (e.g., `LLM`, `Embedding`) to filter the list.
</Step>

<Step>
### Enter Credentials
Enter the required secrets (API Key, Region, etc.).
*   **Encrypted Storage:** Keys are encrypted at rest. Once saved, the full key is never displayed again in the UI.

<Callout type="info" title="Setup Guides">
  Not sure where to find your API Key? Check our detailed connection guides in the **[Integrations Hub](/integrations/providers)**.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Naming & Scope
Give the integration a recognizable name (e.g., "Azure East US").
*   **Workspace Scope:** This integration is available *only* to this specific Business. If you manage multiple clients, Client A cannot see Client B's keys.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Updating Credentials

If you rotate your API keys on the provider side (e.g., generating a new Twilio Token), you must update them here immediately.

1.  Click the **Edit** icon on the integration row.
2.  Paste the new key.
3.  Click **Update**.

<Callout type="warn" title="Immediate Impact">
  Updates take effect instantly. However, any active Agents conversation will keep using the old integration for the lifetime of the conversation so if the old key is invalidated/expired, the conversation may fail. However, modules like phone number may stop working immediately as it depends on active integration if the key is invalidated/expired.
