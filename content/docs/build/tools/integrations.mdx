Before you can create an Agent or buy a Phone Number, you need to connect the underlying infrastructure. The **Integrations Tab** is where you store the API keys and credentials for your third-party providers.

## The Integration Library

Iqra AI supports a wide range of providers. When you add an integration, you will see **Tags** indicating its capabilities.

<Cards>
  <Card icon={<CloudCog />} title="AI Models (LLM)">
    Providers like **OpenAI**, **Azure OpenAI**, **Google Gemini**, and **Anthropic**.
    *   **Usage:** The "Brain" of the agent.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Phone />} title="Telephony">
    Providers like **Twilio**, **Telnyx**, **Vonage**, and **SIP Trunks**.
    *   **Usage:** Buying/connecting phone numbers and handling calls.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Cable />} title="Voice (TTS & STT)">
    Providers like **ElevenLabs**, **Deepgram**, and **Azure Speech**.
    *   **Usage:** The "Mouth" and "Ears" of the agent.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Adding an Integration

Navigate to **Business Dashboard** -> **Integrations**.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Select Provider
Click **Add Integration**. You will see a list of supported services. Select the one you wish to connect (e.g., **OpenAI**).
</Step>

<Step>
### Enter Credentials
Most integrations require an **API Key**.
*   *Simple:* For OpenAI/ElevenLabs, just paste the key.
*   *Complex:* For Azure, you may need the Region, Endpoint URL, and Deployment Name.

  For detailed instructions on where to find these keys, please refer to the [Integrations Guide](/integrations).

</Step>

<Step>
### Naming
Give the integration a recognizable name (e.g., "My Production Twilio" or "Azure East US"). This name will appear in dropdown menus throughout the platform.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Isolation & Scope

Integrations added here are **Specific to this Business Workspace**.

*   **Isolation:** If you manage multiple businesses (e.g., for different clients), Client A cannot use Client B's OpenAI key, even if you own both businesses.
*   **Security:** API Keys are encrypted at rest. Once saved, the full key is never displayed again in the UI.

## Editing & Updating

You can edit an integration at any time to update a rotated API key or change configuration details.

<Callout type="warn" title="Impact Analysis">
  Changing an integration's credentials will immediately affect **all** Agents and Phone Numbers using it. If you invalidate a Twilio key, all active phone numbers linked to that integration will stop working immediately.
