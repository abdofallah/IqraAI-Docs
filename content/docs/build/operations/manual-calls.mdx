The **Make Calls** interface is your command center for outbound traffic. Located in the sidebar, it allows you to bypass the API and trigger calls directly from the UI.

## 1. Single Call (Testing)

Designed for rapid QA. Use this to verify your Script logic before launching a campaign.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Select Campaign
Choose the [Outbound Campaign](/build/campaigns/outbound). This loads the default Agent, Script, and Caller ID strategy.
</Step>

<Step>
### Enter Destination
Enter the phone number in **E.164** format (e.g., `+1234567890`).
</Step>

<Step>
### Fill Variables
The system automatically detects variables in your script.
*   **Base Values:** You can fill in default values (e.g., `customer_name` = "Test User") here.
</Step>

<Step>
### Launch
Click **Launch Call**. The system places the call immediately.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Bulk Calls (CSV Upload)

The Bulk Call engine is designed for scale. You can upload thousands of contacts, and the system will process them according to your concurrency limits.

### Base Configuration vs. Overrides
*   **Base Config:** You set default variables in the UI (e.g., `campaign_name` = "Winter Sale").
*   **CSV Overrides:** Any value in the CSV row **overrides** the base configuration for that specific call.

### The CSV Schema
Iqra AI supports a sophisticated CSV format that allows you to change the Agent, Language, or Retries *per row*.

**Required Column:**
*   `to_number`: The destination phone number (International format).

**Advanced Columns (Optional):**

| Header | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `from_number_id` | Override the Caller ID (Must be a valid UUID from your Numbers tab). |
| `dynamic_variables` | A JSON object string containing specific variable values. |
| `override_agent_id` | UUID of a different Agent to handle this specific call. |
| `override_agent_script_id` | UUID of a different Script to run. |
| `override_agent_language_code` | Force a language (e.g., `en`, `ar`) for this call. |
| `override_retry_on_call_declined` | JSON configuration for retry logic. |

### Example CSV Data
Notice how `dynamic_variables` accepts a JSON object for complex data injection.

```csv
to_number,dynamic_variables,override_agent_language_code
+96899999999,"{""first_name"": ""Ali"", ""balance"": 500}",en
+97150000000,"{""first_name"": ""Fatima"", ""balance"": 120}",ar
```

<Callout type="warn" title="CSV Formatting">
  When putting JSON inside a CSV column, you must escape double quotes by doubling them (e.g., `""key"": ""value""`).
</Callout>

## Scheduling & Expiry

You don't have to call everyone right now. You can manage the **Time Window** of the blast.

### 1. Start Time
*   **Immediate:** Begins processing the queue instantly.
*   **Scheduled:** Holds the queue until a specific future date/time.

### 2. Max Schedule Try (Expiry) <CalendarOff className="w-4 h-4 inline"/>
This is a critical "Safety Switch."

*   **The Problem:** You upload 5,000 leads at 4:00 PM. Your concurrency limit is 10 calls. The queue is slow. By 9:00 PM, the system is still dialing, disturbing people at night.
*   **The Solution:** Set **Max Schedule Try** to `08:00 PM`.
*   **Behavior:** If a queued call attempts to launch *after* 8:00 PM, the system **cancels** it automatically.

## Monitoring Progress

Once launched, the job creates a **Queue**.

1.  Go to the **Conversations Tab**.
2.  Filter by **Status: Queued**.
3.  **Concurrency:** The system respects the limits defined in your [Billing Plan](/platform/billing). If you have 50 slots, it processes 50 rows at a time.
