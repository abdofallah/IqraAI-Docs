The **Make Calls** interface is your launchpad. Located in the sidebar (or top action bar) of the Business Dashboard, it allows you to trigger outbound conversations immediately without using the API.

## 1. Single Call (Testing)

The Single Call mode is designed for rapid testing and QA.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Select Campaign
Choose the [Outbound Campaign](/build/campaigns/outbound) you want to use. This determines the Agent, Script, and Caller ID.
</Step>

<Step>
### Enter Destination
Enter the phone number you wish to call.
*   **Format:** E.164 is recommended (e.g., `+1234567890`), but local formats often work if the provider supports it.
</Step>

<Step>
### Fill Variables
If your selected Campaign/Script has **Required Variables** (e.g., `customer_name`), a form will appear. You must fill these in manually for the agent to work correctly.
</Step>

<Step>
### Launch
Click **Launch Call**. The system will initiate the dialing process immediately.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Bulk Calls (CSV Upload)

The Bulk Call mode allows you to upload a spreadsheet to trigger hundreds or thousands of calls.

### The CSV Format
Your CSV file acts as the database for the campaign.

1.  **Required Column:** You **must** have a column for the phone number (e.g., `phone` or `number`).
2.  **Variable Columns:** Add columns for every dynamic variable in your script.

**Example CSV:**
```csv
phone,customer_name,balance,due_date
+15550101,John Doe,500,2023-12-01
+15550102,Jane Smith,120,2023-12-05
```

### Mapping Logic
After uploading the file, Iqra AI will ask you to **Map Columns**.

*   **Phone Number:** Select which column contains the destination number.
*   **Variables:** Match your CSV headers to the Script Variables.
    *   *Script Variable:* `{{ name }}` $\to$ *CSV Column:* `customer_name`

<Callout type="warn" title="Data Types">
  Ensure your CSV data matches the expected type. If your script expects a Date for `due_date`, ensure the CSV column contains valid date strings.
</Callout>

### Scheduling
You don't have to call everyone *right now*.

*   **Immediate:** Starts processing the queue instantly.
*   **Scheduled:** Pick a future date and time. The system will hold the queue until that moment.

### Row-Level Overrides
Before confirming, you can review the parsed data.
*   **Edit:** You can manually fix a typo in a specific row.
*   **Delete:** Remove a specific row if you decided not to call that person.

## Monitoring Progress

Once a Bulk Call is launched, it creates a **Queue**.

You can monitor the progress in the **Conversations Tab**.
*   **Status:** Pending $\to$ In Progress $\to$ Completed/Failed.
*   **Concurrency:** The system will process the queue based on the concurrency limits defined in your [Subscription Plan](/platform/whitelabel/plans). If you have 1,000 rows but a 10-call concurrency limit, it will make 10 calls at a time until finished.
