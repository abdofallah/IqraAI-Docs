The **Conversations Tab** acts as the historical ledger for your business. Every Inbound, Outbound, and Web session is recorded here, providing a complete audit trail from the moment a connection is attempted to the moment it closes.

## The Conversation List

This is your main view for monitoring traffic.

### Status Indicators
Calls go through several states. Understanding them helps in troubleshooting.

| Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Queued** | (Outbound Bulk) The call is waiting for an available concurrency slot. |
| **Ringing** | Connection attempt in progress. |
| **Active** | Live conversation happening right now. |
| **Completed** | Successfully finished. |
| **Failed** | System error or Provider error (e.g., Invalid Number). |
| **Declined** | User rejected the call. |
| **Missed** | User did not answer within the timeout. |

### Filters
You can drill down into the data using filters:
*   **Date Range:** "Last 24 Hours", "This Month".
*   **Type:** Inbound vs Outbound vs Web.
*   **Campaign:** Filter by specific campaigns to analyze performance.

## Conversation Detail View

Clicking on any row opens the **Detail View**. This view is split into three specific tabs.

### 1. Overview (Metadata)
The high-level summary of the session.
*   **Session ID:** The unique UUID (crucial for API debugging).
*   **Cost:** The calculated cost for this specific call.
*   **Duration:** Exact length in seconds.
*   **Post-Analysis:** Displays the generated **Summary**, **Tags**, and **Extracted JSON Data**.

### 2. Media & Transcript
The artifacts of the conversation.
*   **Audio Player:** Listen to the full MP3 recording. You can download this for quality assurance.
*   **Transcript:** A timestamped, speaker-diarized text log of who said what.
    *   *User:* "Hello?"
    *   *Agent:* "Hi, this is Sarah."

### 3. Debug Logs (Traces)
**For Developers.** This is the X-Ray view of the agent's brain. It shows the millisecond-by-millisecond execution flow.

If an agent felt "slow" or gave a "wrong answer," look here.

**What you can see:**
*   **Latency Traces:**
    *   `STT Final` (User finished speaking) $\to$ `LLM Request`
    *   `LLM First Token` (Time to think) $\to$ `TTS Audio Stream`
*   **Tool Execution:**
    *   Inputs passed to the tool.
    *   Raw JSON response received from the API.
    *   Any errors generated by the JavaScript post-processor.
*   **Interruption Events:** Logs when a user barged in and how the VAD/AI handled it.

<Callout type="tip" title="Debugging Latency">
  If you see a high duration between `LLM Request` and `LLM First Token`, check if you are using a slow model (e.g., GPT-4) or a complex system prompt. Switching to a faster model (e.g., GPT-4o-mini or Groq) usually fixes this.
