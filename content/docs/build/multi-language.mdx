Iqra AI is built to be **Native Polyglot**.

Most platforms use a "Translation Layer" (User speaks Arabic -> Translate to English -> AI processes -> Translate back to Arabic). This causes high latency and loss of nuance.

We use a **Parallel Context** architecture. You define the prompt, script, and responses *specifically* for Arabic, and *specifically* for English. The agent switches its entire "Brain" and "Voice" to the target language instantly.

## Configuration

### 1. Business Languages
First, ensure your languages are enabled at the Workspace level.
*   Go to **Settings** -> **General**.
*   Add languages (e.g., `en-US`, `ar-SA`, `es-ES`).
*   Set a **Default Language**.

### 2. Agent Configuration
An agent does not automatically speak all business languages. You must enable them.
1.  Go to **Agent Studio** -> **Intelligence**.
2.  You will see tabs for each Business Language.
3.  **Map Providers:**
    *   *English:* STT (Deepgram Nova-2) / TTS (ElevenLabs Turbo).
    *   *Arabic:* STT (Azure Speech) / TTS (Azure Neural or ElevenLabs Multilingual).

<Callout type="tip" title="Optimization">
  This allows you to pick the *best* provider for each language. Azure might be better for Arabic dialects, while Deepgram is faster for English.
</Callout>

### 3. Script Content
In the **[Script Builder](/build/script)**, every text field (User Query, AI Response) is multi-lingual.

*   **The Global Selector:** Use the dropdown in the top header to switch views.
*   **Validation:** Look for the <CheckCircle2 className="w-4 h-4 text-green-500 inline"/> checkmark next to the language name. This confirms all nodes have content for that language.

## Switching Languages (Runtime)

How does the agent know which language to speak?

### A. Inbound (IVR)
For [Inbound Routes](/build/campaigns/inbound), we recommend an explicit selection.
*   *System:* "Press 1 for English. Press 2 for Arabic."
*   *Result:* The call starts in the selected context.

### B. Outbound (CSV Override)
For [Outbound Campaigns](/build/campaigns/outbound), you define the starting language in the CSV.
*   `to_number`: `+968...` -> `override_agent_language_code`: `ar`

### C. Mid-Call Switching (Dynamic)
The agent can switch languages during the conversation.
*   **Use Case:** User starts in English but struggles, asks "Do you speak Arabic?"
*   **Implementation:** Use the **[Change Language](/build/script/nodes#change-language)** node.
    *   *User Query:* "Speak Arabic" / "حول عربي"
    *   *Action:* Change Language Node (`ar`).
    *   *Result:* The agent immediately swaps STT/TTS providers and loads the Arabic prompt context.
