import { Key, Globe, Shield, AlertTriangle } from 'lucide-react';

The Iqra AI API provides programmatic access to your User and Business dashboards. You can use it to launch calls, manage agents, and retrieve conversation history without logging into the UI.

## Base URL

All endpoints are prefixed with the current version identifier:

```bash
https://app.iqra.bot/api/v1
```

## Authentication

The API uses **Token-based Authentication**. You must include your API Key in the HTTP Header of every request.

1.  Generate a key in the [User Dashboard](/platform/api-keys).
2.  Add the `Authorization` header with the `Token` prefix (note the space).

```http
Authorization: Token iqra_sk_12345abcdef
```

<Callout type="error" title="Common Mistake">
  Do not use `Bearer` prefix. Iqra AI strictly uses `Token`.
</Callout>

### Failed Auth Response
If your key is missing or invalid, the API returns `401 Unauthorized`.

```json
{
  "detail": "Invalid token."
}
```

## Content Types

*   **Requests:** Must accept and send JSON. Set `Content-Type: application/json`.
*   **Responses:** All responses are JSON objects.

## Rate Limiting

To protect the platform, we enforce rate limits on API usage.
*   **Standard:** 60 requests per minute.
*   **Headers:** Check `X-RateLimit-Remaining` in the response headers to track your usage.

If you exceed the limit, you will receive `429 Too Many Requests`.
